1.1 INTRODUCTION



1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
1.2.1 Background of the problem
When it comes to the academic success of students in college, learning to manage one's time is a must. Good time management can help students of all ages to improve how they study. For many students studying is a difficult endeavor that is plagued by procrastination, interruptions, and a general lack of free time. With the development of IIUM KICT Students’ Schedule Maker Mobile Application, students can generate schedule of their subjects into many choices of time arrangements so they can choose wisely the suitable one in order to have better planning for the next semester.

1.2.2 Problem Statement
It is inevitable that IIUM students will face the difficulties whenever they want to pre-register subjects for the upcoming semester schedule. Normally, they will arrange their schedule by doing it manually as writing it on somewhere and searching the desired subjects one by one while they also have to make sure the section they are going to add are not clashed with any other subjects, This actually is really time-consuming. In response to this problem, our study proposes to investigate  the solution for creating a schedule systematically and time-saving despite they are going through a bustle life as a student.

1.3 PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The objective of the project is to ease students arranging the timetables in such a way to save their time. Besides, to generate many options of the schedule in terms of time arrangements. In addition, to avoid the subjects added by students from clashing with one another. The report that we will produce is the Final Report.

1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT
By developing this KICT Student Schedule Maker, our targeted user; KICT students, can create their preferred subject automatically without hassle. The created schedule will then display in a form of a table where they can clearly visualize the duration of each subject for each day. Also, they can create the schedule quickly without worrying about subject clash because user will not be able to click a particular subject if it is clash with a chosen subject. Besides, user can ‘add task’ to a particular subject for any assignment or upcoming quiz as a reminder.

1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT
By developing this KICT Student Schedule Maker, our targeted user; KICT students, can create their preferred subject automatically without hassle. The created schedule will then display in a form of a table where they can clearly visualize the duration of each subject for each day. Also, they can create the schedule quickly without worrying about subject clash because user will not be able to click a particular subject if it is clash with a chosen subject. Besides, user can ‘add task’ to a particular subject for any assignment or upcoming quiz as a reminder.
